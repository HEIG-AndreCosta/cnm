# Lab03 - Session 01 - Multithreading

Follow the steps of the laboratory and complete the information

## Stage 2

What version of OpenMP is implmented in the GNU Compiler Collection available in our boards?

What do we need to do to enable OpenMP?

### Example 1

Explain the behaviour of the value of the variables during the execution when we declare them as

private
firstprivate
shared

### Example 2

How must the sequential implementation takes?
How much the parallel implementation with OpenMP takes?
How have you implimented the parallel dot product with OpenMP?
Does your parallel implementation produce the correct result?
If it does, explain anything you had to consider.
If it does not, explain why.

## Stage 3 Naive implementation matrix

## Stage 5

Measure openMP prediction time

Questions:

* What part(s) of the algorithm have you paralelized?

* Is it faster than the naive implementation? (explain why or why not)
