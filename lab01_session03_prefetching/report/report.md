## 1. Introduction

The goal of this laboratory is to optimize a convolution algorithm implemented in `C++` and binary research implemented in `C` using prefetching techniques.

## 2. Measuring convilution performance

In this part, we will measure the performance of the convolution algorithm implemented in `C++` with multiple offset offset of prefetch and without prefetching.

### 2.1 Convolution without prefetching
