# Lab03 - Session 02 - Neural Networks and OpenMP

Follow the steps of the laboratory and complete the information

## Stage 2

What would happen if all the weights were initialized to 0 instead?

## Stage 3

Provide examples of other activation functions that we could use in this context. 

## Stage 5 - 6 

Where did you include the pragmas?

Train with/out openMP. Use different number of threads

|          | time |
|----------|------|
| Baseline |      |
| openMP   |      |


## Stage 7

Give an analysis of different places and binds combinations.
